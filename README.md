# yarul
Yet Another React UI Library

This repository contains the codebase for the hands-on coding [React-JS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/React-Delhi-NCR/events/254373998/) held on 7th Oct, 2018.

It creates Basic React components using the open source CSS library [CSS-Mint](https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/CSS-Mint)

The Meetup also featured "How to publish NPM packages" followed by creating this codebase into an NPM package itself!
https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarul

## Installation
0. Fork this repository. (optional - in case you want to contribute to this repo)
1. `cd yarul`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. `npm run server`

(TODO: Remove Step 4, so that Dev-Server starts with just `npm start`)
